Data collection process for DNS pipeline is divided into 4 steps. Each sub directory completes one step out of 4 steps.

Explanation of what each directory does is given below

- DNS_pipeline_step_1/ takes an input list of websites and uses the **BIND** server hosted on our machine to resolve all websites.
At the end of this step, we only investigate websites which **BIND** server could not resolve and we managed to find authoritative
name server of that domain. The website which fulfil this criteria are present in ```have_auth_no_ip_extended.common_three_runs.txt```
and format of each line is,
```[CNAME of domain] [IP of authoritative name server of domain] [domain]```

- DNS_pipeline_step_2/ uses **have_auth_no_ip_extended.common_three_runs.txt** as input list and then perform DNS traceroute
on all domains. Moreover, DNS_pipeline_step_2/ also sends spoofed DNS responses for domains in input list. 

**spoof_capture.pcap** contains all spoofed responses received. DNS traceroute data is in a sub directory step4_traceroute/

- DNS_pipeline_step_3/ runs DNS MDA on an input list generated by concatenating **have_auth_no_ip_extended.common_three_runs.txt** files
of each vantage point. Purpose of this step is to run MDA DNS on server side blocked domains detected in each vantage point.
