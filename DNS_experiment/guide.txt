step 1 : run DNS_pipeline_step1 by running "bash ronaldo.sh" command in bundle in test country lists present in MDA_DNS_INPUT and GLOBAL_MDA folder

step 2 : in one of control country, run DNS_pipeline_step2 by running "bash proximity.sh" in control country bundle

step 3 : wait for a time until script completes. its a function of number of domains and gap limit

step 4 : run bash data.sh in DNS_pipeline_step2 

step 5 : in GLOBAL_MDA folder run command "cat *_final_log* > final_log" . This needs to be automated


step 6 : in test_country run "data_processing.sh" in DNS_pipeline_step1 bundle
